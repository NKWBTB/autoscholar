# Scripts to process information in a local Mendeley database

We have two scripts at this point: 
1. [highlight_extract](https://github.com/forrestbao/autoscholar/tree/mendeley/mendeley/highlight_extract) Extract highlights made on PDF papers in Mendeley (only highlights made via Mendeley; highlights made in PDF syntax not applicable)
2. [paper_html_download](https://github.com/forrestbao/autoscholar/tree/mendeley/mendeley/paper_html_download) Download the HTML versions of papers in a group using the URL information stored in a Mendeley database
